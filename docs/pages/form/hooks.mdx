# hooks

W-design `useField` and `useForm` are simple hooks with just a few
lines of codes, it help to update components state with values and other factors for your
form, such as validation, error status, message, and pass those values to the server.

## Use case

Typically, when create a from, we need to resolve the user experience senarios that provide the good way to let user
understand what he/she needs to do to the form by getting response from their behaviour:

- When user is typing
- When user finish adding information into the form
- Response after submit the form.

## Example

<FormExample />

### useField

This hook update component and return an `InputField` props object.
